# INN_Hotels
Logistic Regression and Decision Trees for predicting hotel booking cancellations
  
I started with data preprocessing and EDA using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Next I performed data preprocessing, and then built a model.
Next I checked its performance
Checked to make sure the logistic regression assumptions satisfied.
found optimal threshold and compared precision recall curve vs auc roc curve
Used DecisionTreeClassifier to build decision tree
Pruned decision tree and and performed cost complexity pruning
Compared recall vs alpha 
checked accuracy, recall, F1 score for training and test
Gave Observations and recommendations for INN Hotels and how to better predict booking cancellations
It is important to close the analysis with key findings and recommendations to the busine
