Logistic Regression and Decision Trees for predicting hotel booking cancellations
There were 2 options given to complete this project -- Low Code and Full Code-- 
Low Code option provides most of the code already written with different parts of the notebook having empty cells to complete.
For low code, a presentation in pdf form is turned in, and i choose this option because I had done all my other projects in Full Code. 
I started with data preprocessing and EDA using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Next I performed data preprocessing, and then built a model.
Next I checked its performance
Checked to make sure the logistic regression assumptions satisfied.
found optimal threshold and compared precision recall curve vs auc roc curve
Used DecisionTreeClassifier to build decision tree
Pruned decision tree and and performed cost complexity pruning
Compared recall vs alpha 
checked accuracy, recall, F1 score for training and test
Gave Observations and recommendations for INN Hotels and how to better predict booking cancellations
It is important to close the analysis with key findings and recommendations to the busine
