Logistic Regression and Decision Trees for predicting hotel booking cancellations
I chose to approach this project the low code method
The low-code way is to use an existing solution notebook template to build the solution and then submit a business presentation with insights and recommendations.
full code -s to write all code from scratch and provide actions and insights at the end--I had done all my other projects in full code, but wanted to try this one in low-code to have experience in both types of environments.  
Full code is geared towards those who aspire to be in hands-on coding roles focusing on building solution codes from scratch
Low-code way is geared towards those who aspire to be in managerial roles focusing on solution review, interpretation and communicating with business stakeholders.  
I started with data preprocessing and EDA using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Next I performed data preprocessing, and then built a model.
Next I checked its performance
Checked to make sure the logistic regression assumptions satisfied.
found optimal threshold and compared precision recall curve vs auc roc curve
Used DecisionTreeClassifier to build decision tree
Pruned decision tree and and performed cost complexity pruning
Compared recall vs alpha 
checked accuracy, recall, F1 score for training and test
Gave Observations and recommendations for INN Hotels and how to better predict booking cancellations
It is important to close the analysis with key findings and recommendations to the busine
